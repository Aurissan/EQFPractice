# EQFPractice
My unsuccessful attempt to make a program that predicts the price change of certain items for European Quality Food, LLC (Russia, currently defunct).
Made during some sort of an internship at EQF between 3rd and 4th course at MUCTR. Uses Python with Keras for LSTM network and some ANN models from sklearn
